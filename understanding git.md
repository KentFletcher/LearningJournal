# Understanding Git:
## Version Control
is a system that allows you to revisit different versions of a file, or set of, by recording changes.  Those changed and saved versions will allow you to revert to those, also allows you nto track modifications and modify individuals, and also compare changes made.  *VCS*- Version Control System- allows you to easily catch and fix mistakes.
  * A Local Version Control allows programmers to store changes to files into one database on your hard disk.
  * Centralized Version Control (CVCS) is a single server storing all changes and file versions, allowing for a team of developers to collaborate on single or sets of files.  Streamlining the collaborating process and allowed each member to know what each team members activities, also allows administrators for easier task of divying out privileges.
  * Distributed Version Control (DVCS) mirrored repositories, copies of the files as data backup in the case of corruption or catastrophic loss.  Enable the use of various simultaneous workflows.
  
# What is Git?
Git is software or version control while Git Hub is where you keep files.
It is a DVCS that stores data file made up of snapshots.  Each time you save a changed version, it is called a *commit*, Git take a snapshot of the file and stores it a reference to it.  Commit is Gits version of "Save As...", but each save is just showing what changes were made. Each commit (snapshot) has a label that points to it. ***HEAD*** = The label meaning "You are here".  assign messages as to why you make changes.
* Ability to view, apply, and remove those changes.
* History of those changes.
* Greatly minimizes the irrevesible damage to files, such as an accidental loss.  

## Files within Git reside in 3 main states:
* Commited- Data is securely stored in a local database
* Modified- File has been changed but not commited
* Staged- Flagged a file's
