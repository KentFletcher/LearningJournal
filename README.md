# **Growth Mindset**

 *Growth Mindset* is the idea that knowledge and skills are learned over time through hard work, and pushing yourself to improve.  It essentially thinking to yourself that you do not know something "yet", and then going out there and seeking was to improve.  This thinking allows you to set and reach goals, and then go beyond that which you initially thought possible. The only thing that would hold you back from further learning would be quitting and not pursuing further knowledge. 

# ** 3 Ways to utilize the growth mindset to improve yourself:**

1. Do things that are difficult for you, it will push you out of your comfort zone and cause you to ask questions and seek information.  

1. "No Pain,No Gain". If you do not allow yourself to struggle then you will not move forward, your will simply stay where you are.

1. Listen to others criticisms about you.  Hearing your weaksposts from others can be very difficult, but seeking this out and internalizing it will allow you to be able to take steps to improve yourself.
