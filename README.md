# **Growth Mindset**

 *Growth Mindset* is essentially thinking to yourself that you do not know something "yet".  It is a way of thinking that there are endless possiblities and where you have the ability to achieve goals that you set.  The only thing that would hold you back from further learning would be quitting and not pursuing further knowledge. 

# **Ways to utilize the growth mindset to improve yourself:**

1. _Challenges_ -  Doing things that are difficult for you will push you out of your comfort zone and cause you to ask questions and seek information.  

1. _Effort_ - "No Pain,No Gain". Is the best way to describe why effort is important.  If you do not allow youself to struggle then you will not move forward, your will simply stay where you are.

1. _Obstacles_ - These are things around you that want your attention. 

1. _Criticism_ - Hearing your weaksposts from others can be very difficult.  But seek this out and try and use this knowledge as areas to improve on.

1. _Success of Others_ -  Seeing others succeed can be very benficial.  Let it push you to be better and also to show you where you need to improve.
