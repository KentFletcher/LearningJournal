# How Computers Work:
* Essentially they work by doing 4 tasks:
1. Take in input- That is whatever you tell it to do.
1. Store info- 
1. Processes infor- Once info is sent in to the computer, it the manipulates with a series of commands called an *Algorithm*.  It then send the manipulated info back to be stored until it is ready to be used.
1. Output results-  This varies depending on the task.  can be text, photos, videos, signals, etc. Or the output could just become input to another computer.

* Binary is the backbone of computers.  Made up of 1's and 0's. All info is converted into binary:
 * Text in binary - letters converted into numbers
 * Images in binary - pixels to colors that represent numbers
 * Sound to binary- sound waves converted to numbers

* Circuits and Logic Gates-  lots of varieties.  The smaller the ciruit the faster it is because it has less didtance to travel.

* CPU- Central Processing Unit - calculates information.  Master chip with smaller parts that all have specific funtions.  The CPU gets a command and that commmand tells which circuit to use.

* Hardware- The circuits, wires, speakers, plugs, etc.
* Software- Tells the hardware or computer what to do.
  * Operating System- is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.  It has special abilities that control all othe software on the computer.

In the end, it is the User that makes the computer work.
